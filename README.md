Push swap

In this project we have two stacks: A and B.

My push_swap programme will accept as input either individual numbers (./push_swap 2 -65 100 9) or numbers within a single array (./push_swap "2 -65 100 9").
The numbers will initially be stored in stack A. The programme will use stack B and a set of moves defined in the projects subject to sort the numbers.


In this project I got very familiar with structs, linked lists and leaks.
